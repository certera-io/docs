<h3>Acceptance</h3>
In order to get any license under these terms, you must agree to them as both strict obligations and conditions to all your licenses.

<h3>Copyright License</h3>
The licensor grants you a copyright license for the software to do everything you might do with the software that would otherwise infringe the licensor's copyright in it for any permitted purpose. However, you may only make changes or new works based on the software according to Changes and New Works License, and you may not distribute the software.

<h3>Changes and New Works License</h3>
The licensor grants you an additional copyright license to make changes and new works based on the software for use in the internal business operations of you and your company.

<h3>Patent License</h3>
The licensor grants you a patent license for the software that covers patent claims the licensor can license, or becomes able to license, that you would infringe by using the software.

<h3>Free Trial</h3>
Use to evaluate whether the software suits a particular application for less than 30 consecutive calendar days, on behalf of you or your company, is use for a permitted purpose.

<h3>Personal Uses</h3>
Personal use for research, experiment, and testing for the benefit of public knowledge, personal study, private entertainment, hobby projects, amateur pursuits, or religious observance, without any anticipated commercial application, is use for a permitted purpose.

<h3>Noncommercial Organizations</h3>
Use by any charitable organization, educational institution, public research organization, public safety or health organization, environmental protection organization, or government institution is use for a permitted purpose regardless of the source of funding or obligations resulting from the funding.

<h3>Small Business</h3>
Use of the software for the benefit of your company is use for a permitted purpose if your company has less than 1,000,000 USD (2019) total revenue in the prior tax year. Adjust this revenue threshold for inflation according to the United States Bureau of Labor Statistics' consumer price index for all urban consumers, U.S. city average, for all items, not seasonally adjusted, with 1982â€“1984=100 reference base.

<h3>Fair Use</h3>
You may have "fair use" rights for the software under the law. These terms do not limit them.

<h3>No Other Rights</h3>
These terms do not allow you to sublicense or transfer any of your licenses to anyone else, or prevent the licensor from granting licenses to anyone else. These terms do not imply any other licenses.

<h3>Patent Defense</h3>
If you make any written claim that the software infringes or contributes to infringement of any patent, your patent license for the software granted under these terms ends immediately. If your company makes such a claim, your patent license ends immediately for work on behalf of your company.

<h3>Violations</h3>
The first time you are notified in writing that you have violated any of these terms, or done anything with the software not covered by your licenses, your licenses can nonetheless continue if you come into full compliance with these terms, and take practical steps to correct past violations, within 30 days of receiving notice. Otherwise, all your licenses end immediately.

<h3>No Liability</h3>
As far as the law allows, the software comes as is, without any warranty or condition, and the licensor will not be liable to you for any damages arising out of these terms or the use or nature of the software, under any kind of legal claim.
